# Documentation

### What your site does and its purpose.

Keeps track of people's birthdays. (or edit them if that's ever necissary)
The site also allows for multiple users

### What part of your app does the API handle?

- Creates and Stores the users
- Stores the birthdays that each user wants to keep track of

### What went right and what went wrong?

I though getting the date form to work would be a big part, but it was surprisingly easy becasue of built in js functionality I didn't know about before

I think I got all of the requests handled properly but I really struggled to get a prototype working. Once I mapped everything out on paper it made sense and I was able to get everything working

### If you were to continue, what would you do to improve your app?

I didn't get around to sorting birthdays by date so that upcoming ones appear at the top. That and making it look a little bit nicer.

### How did you go above and beyond?

I don't think I actually did that much, but I am proud of the 'Search or Create' functionality I added at the start that searches for a user and creates one if it can't find any with the specified username.
